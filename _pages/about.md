I am Young-geun Kim, a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before joining UNIST, I was the Hannan Endowed Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University (MSU), and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Departments of Biostatistics and Psychiatry at Columbia University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Seoul National University.

I am a data scientist with expertise in advanced techniques for biomedical data and their dissemination for medical research. My research topics include, but are not limited to:
- Deep generative models for multi-modal biomedical data (e.g., neuroimaging and multi-omics)
- Deep learning for identifying biomarkers associated with mental illness
- Reinforcement learning-based health care
