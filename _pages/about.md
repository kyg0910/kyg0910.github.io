I am Young-geun Kim, a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before joining UNIST, I was the Hannan Endowed Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University (MSU), and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Departments of Biostatistics and Psychiatry at Columbia University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Seoul National University.

In an era of abundant yet complex high-dimensional data, the Representation Learning Lab focuses on statistical methods for representation learning. We aim to discover low-dimensional latent features that capture meaningful patterns and offer greater explainability than the raw data themselves. Our mission is to build AI that is both theoretically grounded and interpretable, with a focus on applying these data-driven methods to biomedical research.

For instance, we work on identifiable representation learning, developing models where learning the data distribution guarantees the recovery of the true conditional distributions of latent representations. We apply these methodologies to analyze neuroimaging data (e.g., functional MRI). By identifying latent biomarkers associated with mental disorders (e.g., Autism, OCD), we strive to advance precision psychiatry.
