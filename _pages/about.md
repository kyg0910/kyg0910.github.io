Welcome to my website! I am Young-geun Kim, a postdoc fellow at the Department of Biostatistics and the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University (Mentor: [Ying Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=08LYEGoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)). My research interests revolve around developing innovative data science tools and promoting their dissemination on real-world problems, with a particular focus on biomedical data. I received a Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Seoul National University (Advisor: [Myunghee Cho Paik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ww1zLWEAAAAJ&hl=en)), in 2021.
