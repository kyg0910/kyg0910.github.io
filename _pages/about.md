I am Young-geun Kim, an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University (MSU). Before joining MSU, I was a postdoc fellow at the Department of Biostatistics and the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University. I received a Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Seoul National University. 

I am a data scientist with expertise in advanced techniques for biomedical data and their dissemination for medical research. My research topics include, but are not limited to:
- Deep generative models for multi-modal biomedical data (e.g., neuroimaging and multi-omics)
- Deep learning for identifying biomarkers associated with mental illness
- Reinforcement learning-based health care
